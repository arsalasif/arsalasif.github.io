      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I last posted here. Life got really busy, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated anything on the website.
What I have been upto After a bunch of freelancing gigs, I moved onto a full-time role as a Senior Software Engineer. Met and worked with a bunch of amazing people, and got back to Canada as well.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently living in this quiet, beautiful city of Kitchener and working remotely.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer who loves wearing many hats. I love software engineering, machine learning and computer vision. After working as a professional software engineer, I completed my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree focused on research in Computer Vision. With a language-agnostic mindset, I am always learning new things, in different domains.
If you need someone who can code as well as research, then feel free to give me a nudge.
Reach out on LinkedIn.</description>
