            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I last posted here. Life got really busy, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated anything on the website.
What I have been upto After a bunch of freelancing gigs, I moved onto a full-time role as a Senior Software Engineer. Met and worked with a bunch of amazing people, and got back to Canada as well.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently living in this quiet, beautiful city of Kitchener and working remotely.</description>

<p>After a bunch of freelancing gigs, I moved onto a full-time role as a Senior Software Engineer. Met and worked with a bunch of amazing people, and got back to Canada as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently living in this quiet, beautiful city of Kitchener and working remotely. Here&rsquo;s a picture from one of the recent sightseeing trips:</p>
